# Welcome to LucidGo! 🎯

## What is LucidGo?

LucidGo is a powerful web-based tool that helps you analyze your Go (Weiqi) games with AI assistance. Built on top of [KataGo](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo), one of the world's strongest Go engines, LucidGo provides visual, real-time analysis to help you understand AI decision-making and improve your game.

## Why LucidGo?

Go is often considered abstract and difficult to understand. While AI engines like AlphaGo and KataGo have revolutionized the game, most players use these tools without understanding how they work. LucidGo bridges this gap by:

- **Visual Analysis**: See AI thinking in real-time through intuitive visualizations
- **Win Rate Tracking**: Understand the flow of the game with move-by-move win probability
- **Policy Network Display**: View where the AI thinks good moves are located
- **Territory Prediction**: See ownership maps showing predicted final territory
- **Customizable Depth**: Adjust analysis strength to balance speed and accuracy

## Key Features

### 🎮 Interactive Game Board

Upload SGF files and navigate through your games with an intuitive interface.

### 📊 Win Rate Analysis

Track how the game's winning probability changes with each move, helping identify critical moments and mistakes.

### 🤖 AI Recommendations

### 🗺️ Ownership Maps
