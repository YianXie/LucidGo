# Mini KataGo is Work in Progress!

We are excited to announce that our [Mini-KataGo](https://github.com/YianXie/Mini-KataGo) project is in work in progress.

## What is Mini-KataGo?

Mini-KataGo is my own implementation of KataGo (though a lot simpler). It uses the same concept and idea as KataGo (NN-Guided MCTS), and allows me to send request to it similar to what I did with KataGo.

## Why did I make Mini-KataGo?

Currently, I know how to deploy and use KataGo, but still has no idea "behind the scene" — I don't know how the AI works. Therefore, in order to enhance my understanding, I decided to make a Go AI by myself, which is not only beneficial to myself, but also to the LucidGo platform.

## When will it be ready?

Based on my plan, it should be ready to use in about 6 months. Sure, it sounds like a lot, but I really have to start from a beginner. :)
